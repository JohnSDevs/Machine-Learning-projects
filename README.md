# Machine-Learning-projects
Collection of different personal projects within ML.


### Mobile flash classification
I wanted to combine HW development and ML for this project. I have a great intrest in Edge ML and how it can benefitial to have instant feedback from a model.

### Timeseries classification
Different TS experimets with Scikit-learn 

### Auto ML with Teapot

### Tensorflow Serving with Python Flask API
This is a boilerplate for a dockerized model deployment. It consists of a model, Tesonrflow serving and an API to make requests.

### Transfer lerarning with Keras
Multilabel classification for transfer learning with images.

### Object detection with Google object detection API
